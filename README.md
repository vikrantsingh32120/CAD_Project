Project Title
This is a simple text editor built with React and Quill, with data stored in MongoDB.

Description
The text editor allows users to create and edit rich text documents, with the data stored in a MongoDB database. It uses the Quill library to provide a WYSIWYG editor with a rich set of formatting options, and socket.io for real-time collaboration between multiple users.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js
npm or yarn
MongoDB
Installing
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-editor.git

Modify the MongoDB connection string in server/db.js to match your own MongoDB instance:
rust
Copy code
const uri = 'mongodb://your-username:your-password@your-mongodb-instance-url';
Start the development server: npm start or yarn start
Usage
To use the text editor, simply open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000. You can then create or edit rich text documents using the formatting options provided by the Quill library. Multiple users can collaborate on the same document in real-time thanks to socket.io.

Deployment
To deploy the application to a production environment, you can use the following command:

Copy code
npm run build
This will create a production-ready build of the application in the build folder.
